# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide is a a webpage produced during my prework tasks of the bootcamp. This page is designed to show notes on the core subjects covered within the prework which include HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. I have learned a basic understanding on HTML, CSS and Git and have been shown some very basic JavaScript which I look forward to furthering my learning on this topic during the bootcamp. 

This webpage displays notes taken during my prework sessions on the core subjects as listed above for easy reference when needing to catch back up on any notes. I have learned a great deal into the basics of each subject. However there is still much to learn!
